#Work at m›PATH. We are working on something awesome.

###Are you serious about code? Because code is serious business.


##Why would you work at m›PATH?

We're working hard to create a company that we would want to work for. This means an engineering-centered culture and respect for intelligent problem-solvers.

 We've come up with a novel way of approaching native mobile app development, that we think will help nearly every company.

* We are looking for bright people to come together and solve interesting problems
* We are enabling non-developers to build native mobile apps that will make their work, and their lives easier. Yay for helping someone go home a little earlier, right?
* We are early stage, and thus seeking generalists who do great work.
* We are opinionated, and you are too...
* ...Yet we respect the diversity of our backgrounds, and feel that the culmination of those experiences create better products.
* Ask forgiveness, not permission. If you want to get something done, do it.
* We are remote friendly.
* We pay well.
* We have excellent benefits.
* We have two sweet offices in both SF and Palo Alto.
