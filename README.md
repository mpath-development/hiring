##Are you serious about building great products?

##What is mâ€ºPATH?

We're working hard to create a company that we all want to work for. This means an product-centered culture and respect for intelligent problem-solvers.

The mPATH platform is a new and novel way of approaching native mobile app development, which we think will help nearly every company. Right now we have to be a bit stealthy for business reasons, but we can tell you a lot more in person.

* We are enabling non-developers to build native mobile apps that will make their work, and their lives easier. Yay for helping someone go home a little earlier, right?
* The product is nearing beta. We've received fantastic feedback so far.

###What's it like working here?
* We're building an ace team. Thus we are looking for bright people to come together and solve interesting engineering and interaction problems
* We are early stage, and thus seeking generalists who do great work.
* We are opinionated, and you are too...
* ...Yet we respect the diversity of our backgrounds, and feel that the culmination of those experiences create better products.
* Ask forgiveness, not permission. If you want to get something done, do it.
* We are remote friendly.
* We pay well.
* We have excellent benefits.
* We have two sweet offices in both SF and Palo Alto.
